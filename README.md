# Happy BirdDay!

A very basic (yet adorable) calculator
that tells you how old you are in bird years.
See this calculator in action [here!](https://js-3-4-5-sba-kirstendanica.jfs-5.repl.co/)

## SBA

This was assigned as a skills assessment for
objects in JavaScript and the DOM. The assignment
did **not** require this level of styling, I just
finished the actual assignment / assessment early. â˜º

As you can *probably* see, I enjoyed this very much.
